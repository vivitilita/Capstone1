# financial-calculator
* This is my first capstone project. 
* This is a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: 
 1. An investment calculator
+ :pushpin: If the user selects ‘investment’: 
- [x] Ask the user to input:
+ The amount of money that they are depositing.
+ The interest rate (as a percentage). 
+ The number of years they plan on investing.
+ Then ask the user to input if they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on whether or not they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period, at the specified interest rate.
- [x] Print out the answer!
 2. A home loan repayment calculator.
+ :pushpin: If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following: 
- [x] Ask the user to input:
+ The present value of the house. e.g. 100000
+ The interest rate. e.g. 7
+ The number of months they plan to take to repay the
bond. e.g. 120
- [x] Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the answer.

### The key learnings:
- :paperclip: Using variables (string and numerical data types)
- :paperclip: Boolean data types and if/elif/else statements
- :paperclip: Logical programming operators
